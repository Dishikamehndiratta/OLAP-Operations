**OLAP Operations on Sales Data**
**Overview**
The OLAP Operations on Sales Data project is a structured database solution designed to analyze and explore sales data using Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) techniques. By performing operations such as Drill Down, Rollup, Cube, Slice, and Dice, the project aims to uncover insights from sales data across multiple dimensions, enabling better decision-making and data-driven strategies.

**Objective**
**The primary goal of this project is to:**
    Analyze sales data across dimensions such as product, region, and time.
    Use OLAP operations to gain insights and perform aggregations at various levels of granularity.
    Create a scalable and efficient system for multi-dimensional data analysis.

**Features**

  **OLAP Operations**
        Drill Down: Analyze data at a more detailed level, such as viewing sales performance by product within a region.
        Rollup: Summarize data at higher levels of granularity, such as total sales by region.
        Cube: Explore data from multiple dimensions (e.g., product, region, and date) simultaneously.
        Slice: Filter data to focus on a specific region or time period.
        Dice: View subsets of data based on multiple criteria, such as specific product-region-date combinations.

  **Data Aggregation and Filtering**
        Perform aggregations such as total and average sales across dimensions.
        Apply filters to extract subsets of data for targeted analysis.

  **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**
        Enables exploration of sales trends and patterns from various perspectives.
        Identifies key performance indicators (KPIs) like best-performing regions or top-selling products.

**Database Structure**

**The project uses a relational database with the following table:**
    sales_sample:
        Columns: Product_Id, Region, Date, Sales_Amount.
        Stores transactional sales data with attributes for products, regions, and sales figures.

**Technologies Used**
    SQL Server: For database management and OLAP query execution.
